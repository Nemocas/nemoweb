<h2>Authors</h2>

<p>Nemo has been developed since 2014 by a number of people. Initially
the library was started by William Hart, Claus Fieker, Fredrik Johansson
and Tommy Hofmann.</p>

<p>The authors of Nemo to date:</p>

<ul>

<li>William Hart -- maintainer, general infrastructure, Flint wrapper,
Pari wrapper, initial generic modules and overall design (supported by
DFG Priority programme SPP1489)</li>

<li>Tommy Hofmann -- maintainer, fq_poly, fq_nmod_poly, nmod_mat and nmod_poly
modules, plus numerous (also one of the main authors of Hecke)
patches</li>

<li>Claus Fieker -- maintainer, numerous patches to build system, polynomial,
linear algebra and number fields code (also one of the main authors of
Hecke and supervisor of student projects using Nemo)
</li>

<li>Fredrik Johansson -- maintainer, polynomial truncation and mullow,
Chebyshev polynomials and exp for power series</li>

<li>Oleksandr Motsak -- Initial Singular wrapper</li>
</ul>
