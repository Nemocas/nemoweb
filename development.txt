<h3>Development ideas</h3>

<p>Our GitHub issue tracker: 
<a href="https://github.com/wbhart/nemo.jl/issues">https://github.com/wbhart/nemo.jl/issues</a></p>

<p>Here is a list of ideas for development projects that would be highly valuable to a large
number of users. Some of these could make good student projects (or in some cases, research projects).
</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement generic Pusiseux series with automatic inflation/deflation</li>
<li>Add the capped absolute model of power series</li>
<li>Wrap the <a href="http://fredrikj.net/arb/">Arb</a> library (it is already built as part of
the Nemo build process)</li>
<li>Implement generic Hermite Normal Form</li>
<li>Interface with Gap or wrap libgap</li>
<li>Implement symbolic expressions</li>
</ul>

<p>
A longer list of (mostly minor) issues to work on can be found in the
