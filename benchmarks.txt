<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>This page shows how Nemo compares to other computer algebra software on a selection of
artificial benchmarks.</p>

<h3>Fateman benchmark</h3>

<ul>
<li>f = 1 + x + y + z + t</li>
<li>p = f^30</li>
<li>time q = p*(p + 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark tests generic polynomial arithmetic. Note that we don't have a dedicated multivariate polynomial module in Nemo yet, so this and the next benchmark are done with nested univariate polynomial rings. Where possible we do the same thing in the other systems we time (Pari/GP is an exception).</p>

<h3>Pearce benchmark</h3>

<ul>
<li>f = (x + y + 2z^2 + 3t^3 + 5u^5 + 1)^16</li>
<li>g = (u + t + 2z^2 + 3y^3 + 5x^5 + 1)^16</li>
<li>time q = f*g</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark is usually done with sparse multivariate polynomial arithmetic. We use it
here with our recursive dense polynomial arithmetic (there is no sparse polynomial representation in Nemo yet).</p>

<p>Note: this is not fair to other packages that implement sparse multivariate polynomial arithmetic,
as they could complete this benchmark faster if we used their sparse arithmetic. But that
would not be a very meaningful benchmark if the aim is to measure the relative performance
of the recursive dense polynomial arithmetic in Nemo. On the other hand, Pari/GP uses a
sparse-recursive representation (similar to recursive-dense, but with dedicated zero objects in each ring).</p>

<h3>Determinant over a commutative ring</h3>

<ul>
<li>n = 2003*1009</li>
<li>R = (Z/nZ)[x]</li>
<li>M is an 80x80 matrix with entries in R of random degree of at most 5 and
coefficients in the range [-100, 100] modulo n</li>
<li>time d = determinant(M)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark is designed to test determinant over a generic commutative
ring. Note Pari cheats here and does divisions, which will occasionally cause
it to fail on such examples.<p>

<p>Magma exhausts the memory on the machine after some hours. Timings indicate
it uses an exponential algorithm which would take > 42369865294301626368s were
it given infinite memory.</p>

<h3>Determinant over a field</h3>

<li>K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1)</li>
<li>M is an 80x80 matrix with random entries in K of the form c_0 + c_1*a + c_2*a^2 with c_i in the range [-100, 100]</li>
<li>time d = determinant(M)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark is designed to test determinant over a field where there is
coefficient blowup.</p>

<h3>Determinant of a matrix over a polynomial ring</h3>

<ul>
<li>M is an 40x40 matrix with random entries in ZZ[x] of the form c_0 + c_1*x + c_2*x^2 with c_i in the range [-20, 20]</li>
<li>time d = determinant(M)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark is designed to test determinant over a polynomial ring over an integral domain.</p>

<div align="center">

<table class="benchmark">

<h3>Linear solving over a polynomial ring</h3>

<ul>
<li>M is an 20x20 matrix with random entries in ZZ[x][y] that are quadratic polynomials in y with coefficients of the form c_0 + c_1*x + c_2*x^2 with c_i in the range [-20, 20], and b is a 20x1 matrix over the same ring</li>
<li>time x, d = solve(M, b)</li>
</ul>

<p>The computation finds a 20x1 matrix x over ZZ[x][y] and a denominator d in ZZ[x][y] such that Ax = db.</p>

<p>This benchmark is designed to test linear solving over a generic polynomial ring.</p>

<p>SageMath exhausted the memory on the machine and didn't complete, possibly because it doesn't reduce the bivariate rational functions that result, at any stage. On the other hand, we were forcing SageMath to work in iterated univariate polynomial rings rather than a true bivariate polynomial ring, which may explain the slowdown and memory use.</p>

<p>Magma requires the computation to be performed over the fraction field.</p>

<h3>Characteristic polynomial of a matrix over the integers</h3>

<ul>
<li>M is an 80x80 matrix with random entries in ZZ in the range [-20, 20]</li>
<li>time d = charpoly(M)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark doesn't really test Nemo but the underlying Flint library.
However, the benchmark resulted from work done in Nemo that got moved into
Flint. Julia code can be quite easy to port to C in certain circumstances.</p>

<h3>Minimal polynomial of a matrix over a gcd domain</h3>

<ul>
<li>Let M be a 20x20 matrix with random entries in ZZ[x] of degree 2 with coefficients in the range [-20, 20], but such that the upper right and lower left quarters of the matrix are zero and the lower right quarter is identical to the upper left quarter</li>
<li>Let P(r, d) denote a 20x20 identity matrix the zero entries of whose r-th row have been replaced with the value d</li>
<li>Apply ten random similarity transforms M = P^{-1}MP to M where each P is a matrix of the form P(r, d) for r in the range [1, 20] and d in the range [-3:3]</li>
<li>time d = minpoly(M)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark tests minimal polynomial over a gcd domain (i.e. not over a field).</p>

<p>Magma refuses to do this computation and Sage throws an exception.</p>

<h3>Minimal polynomial of a matrix over a finite field</h3>

<ul>
<li>Let R be a finite field of order 103^2</li>
<li>Let M be a 80x80 matrix with random entries in R, but such that the upper right and lower left quarters of the matrix are zero and the lower right quarter is identical to the upper left quarter</li>
<li>Let P(r, d) denote an 80x80 identity matrix the zero entries of whose r-th row have been replaced with the value d</li>
<li>Apply ten random similarity transforms M = P^{-1}MP to M where each P is a matrix of the form P(r, d) for r in the range [1, 80] and d in the range [-3:3]</li>
<li>time d = minpoly(M)</li>
</ul>

<p>This benchmark tests minimal polynomial over a finite field, and finite field arithmetic.</p>

<p>Magma is so fast in this example because it uses Zech logarithms and because it just has very fast finite field arithmetic. We are currently using generic matrices over Flint finite field elements and we are not using Zech logarithms. Both are areas for future improvement.</p>
