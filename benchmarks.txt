<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>This page shows how Nemo compares to other computer algebra software on a selection of
artificial benchmarks.</p>

<h3>Fateman benchmark</h3>

<p>Compute f = 1 + x + y + z + t in Z[x, y, z, t]; p = f^30; and time q = p*(p + 1).</p>

<p>This benchmark is usually done with sparse multivariate polynomial arithmetic. We use it
here for dense univariate polynomial arithmetic.</p>

<p>Note: this is not fair to other packages that implement sparse polynomial arithmetic,
as they could complete this benchmark faster if we used their sparse arithmetic. But that
would not be a very meaningful benchmark if the aim is to measure the relative performance
of the dense, univariate polynomial arithmetic in Nemo.</p>
